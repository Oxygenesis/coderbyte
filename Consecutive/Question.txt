Have the function `Consecutive(arr)` take an array of integers
and return the minimum number of integers needed to make the contents
of the array consecutive from the lowest number to the highest number.
For example, if `arr` contains `[4, 8, 6]`, then the output should be `2`
because two numbers need to be added to the array (5 and 7) to make it a consecutive array from 4 to 8.
Negative numbers may be entered as well.

**Examples:**
- Input: `[4, 8, 6]`
  Output: `2`

- Input: `[5, 10, 15]`
  Output: `8`

**Note:**
- The input array will always contain at least two integers.
- The integers in the array may be positive, negative, or zero.
- The integers in the array will not necessarily be sorted.

Your task is to write a function, `Consecutive(arr)`,
that calculates and returns the minimum number of integers needed to make the given array consecutive.
