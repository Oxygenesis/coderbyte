Have the function `FindIntersection(strArr)` read the array of strings stored in `strArr` which will contain two elements: the first element will represent a list of comma-separated numbers sorted in ascending order, and the second element will represent a second list of comma-separated numbers (also sorted). Your goal is to return a comma-separated string containing the numbers that occur in elements of `strArr` in sorted order. If there is no intersection, return the string `"false"`.

**Examples:**
- Input: `["1, 3, 4, 7, 13", "1, 2, 4, 13, 15"]`
  Output: `"1,4,13"`

- Input: `["1, 3, 9, 10, 17, 18", "1, 4, 9, 10"]`
  Output: `"1,9,10"`

**Note:**
- The input array will always contain exactly two elements.
- Each element will be a comma-separated list of numbers.
- The numbers within each list will be sorted in ascending order.
- The numbers may be positive or negative integers.
- If there is no intersection between the two lists, return the string `"false"`.

Your task is to write a function, `FindIntersection(strArr)`, that finds the intersection of the two comma-separated number lists and returns the result as a comma-separated string.
